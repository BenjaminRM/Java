Instructions for the Augusta Developer Java Project |
----------------------------------------------------

All the commands you will need are on the left side of the screen.
Simply drag and drop the commands onto the right side of the screen (within the border that outlines the right side) to place them within your program.
	HINT: If you see the command, the command is in your program.  If it dissappears, it was not added.
Any command with parenthesis is able to be double clicked for more options.  Ex: For the "REPEAT" command, you can select 2-9 for how many times you want it to repeat.

Here are some rules that every program must follow in order to be validated:

	1. Every program MUST end with a HALT command.  Any program with HALT anywhere else but as the last node will not be considered valid.

	2. Ever IF CRUMB, IF ACCESS, WHILE ACCESS, or REPEAT command must begin with a BEGIN command, and end with an END command.
		EX:
				REPEAT (3)
					BEGIN
					FORWARD
					END	

	3. Every IF CRUMB and IF ACCESS command does not require an ELSE command, but it may be used to signify there is are items desired for the elsePart.

Once your program command chain is built, simply press the "Save" button.  To Reset the fields, press the "Reset" button.
