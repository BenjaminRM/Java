        CSCI-140/242: Computer Science AP/X<br>
        Lab 10 - Tents and Trees
    </h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	You are in charge of a campground and need to tell campers where they can each pitch a tent.
	Your campground is a square grid.  Some cells contain a tree, others do not.  Campers
	want shade, so the tents must be near a tree.  Campers want space, so the tents can't
	be near each other.  You need to find places for as many tents as there are trees,
	while satisfying all the criteria of the puzzle!
</p>

<p>
	Below is an example of what a tents and trees puzzle looks like initially:
</p><center>
	<img src="./CSCI 140_242_ Computer Science AP_X - Lab 10_files/tents1.png" width="250">
</center>
<p></p>

<p></p>
    The rules for the puzzle are as follows:

    <ul>
    <li>The total number of tents placed must equal the total number of trees.</li>
    <li>Each tent must be either horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tree.</li>
    <li>No tent may be horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to another tent.</li>
    <li>Each row or column must have the exact number of tents specified by the number to
    the right (row) or bottom (column).</li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    Using these rules, the solution to the puzzle above looks like:

</p><center>
    <img src="./CSCI 140_242_ Computer Science AP_X - Lab 10_files/tents1-sol.png" width="250">
</center>
<p></p>


<h3>Input Specification</h3>

<p>
    An initial tent config will be specified on the command line using an ASCII input file.
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents3.txt" target="_blank">Here is a link</a> to the file
    which corresponds to the picture of the above puzzle's initial configuration.
</p>

<p>
    We will use the following characters to represent the various possible
    input values for a cell:

</p><table border="1" width="20%">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td align="center"><b>Symbol</b></td>
        <td align="center"><b>Meaning</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><tt>.</tt></td>
        <td align="center">Empty</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><tt>%</tt></td>
        <td align="center">Tree</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>

<p>
    The format of the file is explained with comments "//" at the end of each line.

</p><pre>    4         // the square dimension of the field
    1 1 1 0   // the row looking values from top to bottom
    0 2 0 1   // the column looking values from left to right
    % . . .   // the first row
    . . % .   // the second row
    . . . .   // the third row
    . % . .   // the fourth row
                                    // extra input that should be ignored
    A 4x4 grid with the solution:   // ...
                                    // ...
     -------                        // ...
    |% ^ # #|1                      // ...
    |# # % ^|1                      // ...
    |# ^ # #|1                      // ...
    |# % # #|0                      // ...
     -------                        // ...
     0 2 0 1                        // ...
</pre>
<p></p>


<h3>Output Specification:</h3>

<p>
If there is a solution to the puzzle, it should be displayed.  We will use the following
characters to represent the various possible output values for a cell:

</p><table border="1" width="20%">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td align="center"><b>Symbol</b></td>
        <td align="center"><b>Meaning</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><tt>#</tt></td>
        <td align="center">Grass</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><tt>^</tt></td>
        <td align="center">Tent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td align="center"><tt>%</tt></td>
        <td align="center">Tree</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p></p>

<p>
    This output corresponds to the solution for the sample puzzle above.

</p><pre>    Solution:
     -------
    |% ^ # #|1
    |# # % ^|1
    |# ^ # #|1
    |# % # #|0
     -------
     0 2 0 1
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
    If there is no solution to the puzzle, the output should just be:

</p><pre>    No solution!
</pre>
<p></p>

<h4>Timing Output</h4>

<p>
    The time it takes to try to solve a puzzle should be displayed, in seconds,
    regardless if the puzzle has a solution or not:

</p><pre>    Elapsed time: # seconds.
</pre>
<p></p>

<h4>Debug Output</h4>

<p>
    If a debug flag is enabled on the command line, a GUI will come
    up that displays the sequence of configurations, valid and invalid,
    that are generated using the backtracking algorithm.
    <b>This sequence will vary depending on how successors are generated and pruned</b>.
    You can use the slider with the left/right arrows keys, or the mouse, to
    cycle through the configurations.  Special thanks goes to
    <a href="http://dwgpi.student.rit.edu/~pi/tents/debugger.html" target="_blank">David Grzebinski</a>
    for developing this tool.
</p><center>
    <img src="./CSCI 140_242_ Computer Science AP_X - Lab 10_files/debugger.png" width="350">
</center>
<p></p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents3-out-debug.txt" target="_blank">Here is an example</a>
    of the complete debug output of the instructor solution for the sample puzzle.
    If you prefer to get the debug output from standard output in the same fashion 
    as this example, you need to uncomment the print line in <tt>Backtracker.java</tt>:

</p><pre>    private void debugPrint(String msg, Configuration config) {
        if (this.debug) {
            //System.out.println(msg + ":\n" + config);
            configLog.add(new Pair&lt;&gt;(config,msg.trim()));
        }
    }
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
    Also note that the GUI debugger uses the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX" target="_blank">Java FX</a>
    software platform, which requires the use of Java 8.
</p>


<h3>Program Requirements</h3>

<p>
You will complete this portion of the lab on your own.
Here are the Javadocs for the program you will develop:
</p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>

<ul>
<li>    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/doc/TentsAndTrees.html" target="_blank"><tt>TentsAndTrees</tt></a>:  This is the main program, which you should not modify.
It runs with two required arguments:
<ol>
    <li>The name of the input file</li>
    <li>"true" if debugging is enabled, "false" otherwise</li>
</ol>

</li><li><a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/doc/Backtracker.html" target="_blank"><tt>Backtracker</tt></a>: This is the backtracking algorithm that was developed
    in class.  It should not be modified.</li>
    
<li>    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/doc/Configuration.html" target="_blank"><tt>Configuration</tt></a>:  This is the interface the Backtracker uses for
    a puzzle's configuration representation.  It should not be modified.</li>
    
<li>    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/doc/TentConfig.html" target="_blank"><tt>TentConfig</tt></a>: This is the class that is used to represent
          a configuration in the Tents And Trees
    puzzle.  It should be written by you.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h4>Starter Code</h4>
<p>
You can download the starter code from <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/src/code.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
For this assignment you must use the provided backtracking algorithm to obtain
a solution.  You are free to design your <tt>TentConfig</tt> class however
you see fit.

</p><h4>Pruning</h4>

<p>
You must do a reasonable amount of pruning in order to receive full credit for 
this project:

    </p><ul>
    <li>
        Each time a tent is placed you must check that there is at least one neighboring tree.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each time a tent is placed you must check that there are no adjacent surrounding tents.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you reach the last cell in the grid, you must:
        <ul>
            <li>
                check that all row and column looking values equal the number of corresponding tents.
            </li>
            <li>
                check that each tree has at least one neighbor tent.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
    To assist you with measuring the effectiveness of your pruning, we are providing some
    sample data files for you to test with.  Keep in mind that the speed of your machine
    is going to influence how long it takes to run the tests, so use these masurements as
    a "ballpark" figure.

    </p><ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents7.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents7.txt</tt></a>: A 8x8 puzzle that has a solution.
        <b>For 20% functionality credit, you should be able to solve this puzzle in under a minute.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents8.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents8.txt</tt></a>: A 12x12 puzzle that has a solution.
        <b>For 5% extra credit, you should be able to solve this puzzle in under a minute.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents9.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents9.txt</tt></a>: A 16x16 puzzle that has a solution.
            <b>For 10% extra credit, you should be able to solve this puzzle in under 2 minutes.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents10.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents10.txt</tt></a>: A 20x20 puzzle that has a solution.
            We will not be testing with this as it is very large and takes more than 5 minutes to
            solve (with very efficient pruning).  But feel free to see how you do with it.
    </li>

    </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
   <b>Please note! the timings you need to achieve are with debugging disabled (debug flag on command line
      is set to false).
      This is done to eliminate the amount of time spent doing output, which can be quite
      massive for larger puzzles.</b>
</p>

<h4>Rule Breaking: Each Tree Must Have A Unique Neighbor</h4>

<p>
    There is one aspect of the tents and trees puzzle that we are not going to have you deal with.
    It is the rule that each tree have one unique tent "attached" to it.  It turns out that
    it is insufficient to only 
    check that each tree has at least one tent next to it.  You also can't
    reject a configuration where a tree has more than one adjacent tent, because it may be
    valid.  In the example below, the tree in the top row sees two
    adjacent tents.  This isn't a problem because it can be seen as being attached
    to the left tent, while the tree in the bottom row is attached to the
    right tent.

<p>
    Thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~atd" target="_blank">Professor Deever</a>,
    we have an example that shows how this can come about.
    Take a look at <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents13.txt" target="_blank">this example</a>,
    and the commentary in it.  Again, we will not test with this kind of example, but
    you should be aware the problem exists.
</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>
    Backtracking is a concept that a lot of new students have problems picking up.
    The first hurdle is understanding what exactly is going on.
    Recall that the
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci142/Lectures/09/backtracking.pdf" target="_blank">lecture notes</a>
    the map coloring problem are at your
    disposal.  Great effort was put into making those notes so that you can understand
    the problem and see how it is
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csci142/Lectures/09/code.zip" target="_blank">implemented in Java</a>.
</p>

    It is very hard for even a seasoned programmer to write a configuration class
    for a backtracker correctly on the first try.
    It requires that you have some pretty good debugging skills (e.g. setting breakpoints
    and analyzing code).  To begin with, we suggest you work with these two smaller puzzles:

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents1.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents1.txt</tt></a>: A 2x2 puzzle that has a solution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents2.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents2.txt</tt></a>: A 3x3 puzzle that has a solution.
    </li>
</ul>

    Do not stop when you have these working.  You should test with puzzles that truly have no solution,
    as well as the puzzle with the minimal pruning requirement,
    <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~csapx/Labs/10/data/tents7.txt" target="_blank"><tt>tents7.txt</tt></a>
<p></p>


<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
Submit just your configuration class, <tt>TentConfig.java</tt>, along with your Git log file to <tt>try</tt>.
It will automatically combine your implementation with all the other provided files that should not
be modified.  Use the command:

</p><pre>    try csapx-grd lab10-1 TentConfig.java log.txt
</pre>

Recall that you can verify your submission using the command:

<pre>    try -q csapx-grd lab10-1
</pre>
